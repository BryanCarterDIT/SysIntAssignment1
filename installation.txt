Copy tsh to /usr/local/bin
Copy tsh.conf to /etc/
add "/usr/local/bin/./tsh" line to /etc/shells
Run command sudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin./tsh %USER% and enter sudo password.

This gives the error "chsh: PAM: Authentication failure" but does update the 

/etc/passwd file with the new path. Logging in with the user results in access being 

denied even with repeated password changes. I don't actually know what the problem is, 

but it seems to be one I shouldn't be having.
